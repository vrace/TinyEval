WANE'S Tiny Evaluator

WANE's Tiny Evaluator is a tiny yet very useful library served as an inplace
evaluator. It accepts a limited subset of the Scheme language.

Main features of the library are:
- Tiny code base
- Easy integrate with C

The files are organized with Visual Studio 2005. However, the files are simple
enough that everyone can reconstruct a project/makefile without any problem.
